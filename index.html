    <!-- Replace this text with your description of the project -->
    <p class="description">My Name is Jose Colon.  I'm 23 years old and have always bin a hardcore gamer.  I've bin into video games since the day I got a gameboy (was 3 or 4 years old at the time.) And as of today I still play video games, except now I stream myself playing live on Twitch.tv. The main reason I started streaming was that the only thing I could find on Twitch were people who were Diamond or higher on League of Legends or were pro player or even big YouTube stars and I wanted to stream to show that even someone who is not a pro or a star are also good at the games they play.  That a regular player like myself can entertain people or do something or achieve something that wasn't possible for lower tier gamers like myself.  I love streaming I just hope I can get more people to support my stream cause I wish to help people and do charity events or giveaways for anyone. So why not check me out?
